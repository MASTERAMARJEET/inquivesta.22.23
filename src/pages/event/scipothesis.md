Scipothesis is an event in which the participating teams need to knit a story around one or multiple topics provided to them. The topics will be such that the participants need to apply basic or intermediate level concepts they know in a lucid manner and explain it to the audience. The audience will have high school students as well so the teams should present their work in such a way that it is understandable to them. Participants will be allowed to choose a single topic or multiple topics among the given topics and connect them properly. The participating teams can choose whichever way of explaining is convenient to them like making a presentation, or creating short animated videos, or making physical miniature models, etc.
