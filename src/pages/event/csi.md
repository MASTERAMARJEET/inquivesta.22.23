Whodunnit? It wasn’t us, perhaps…..it was you! There’s only one way to find out. Take control of your fates and seize the day!

This is your chance to become the detective you have always wanted to be, ever since you switched on your screen and saw that high functioning sociopath running around 221B Baker Street with that doctor friend of his. But how, you ask? Elementary, of course , because we bring you an event that is sure to wrap you up in its charm!

CSI Deduce is a unique event of Inquibytes, where participants get to put on their thinking caps and catch the criminal masterminds behind heinous murders, shocking robberies and more.
